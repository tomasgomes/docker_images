## Description

This folder contains `.bash_profile` file with a collection of useful things to add to a server `.bash_profile`.

**WARNING**: if you already have a `.bash_profile` file in your home (`~`) folder, do not simply replace it with the one presented here, since you may lose other things set up in your previous file.

The lines here included are tailored to iMM's Lobo server.
